# Email-verification-from-scratch-using-nodeMailer-
Code for verification of email that is entered by the user while signing up for any website. It makes use of nodeMailer to send emails but the code for verifying the OTP is being written from scratch. The sender email and sender password is needed to be updated in the app.js file. To protect from data breach, the email and password of sender can be copied into a .env file and accessed using process.env.email. But first install 'dotenv' package for it.

Little bit of help is provided here if you need more directions of how to use it.
